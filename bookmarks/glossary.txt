				i:/images/costModelPricingWorkflow.png
					Composition
						Pricing
						t:Exercice allowing unit price calculation + extra layer before publication
						Chargeback
						t:Client consumption billing
						Showback
						t:Client consumption shown but not billed. Clients reports are visible on 'Unified reporting'.
					Service definitions
						TSE
						t:Technical Service Element (provider's perspective).
						d:Technical Service Element is an internal (technical) element in a certain sector, to which we map the activity codes and the hosting of the IS (if any).
						BSE
						t:Business Service Element (client's perspective)
						d:Business Service Element is the service itself, the one we sell to our customers. A BSE can have one TSE mapped to it 100% or can be combined by several TSEs from different Units/Directorates.
						Cost Driver
						d:Cost Driver is the measurable element which defines the unit cost of each element:<dl><dt>TSE's cost driver</dt><dd>virtual driver (100%)</dd><dt>BSE's cost driver</dt><dd>the value of the driver on the 1st of January Y(n).</dd></dl>The cost driver of a BSE is the value of the driver fixed on January 1st of the considered year.
						Costing
						t:The exercise of calculating the real unit cost at the end of the annual pricing exercise
						Pricing
						t:The extra layer added by the Director before publishing

					SIP
					t:Session Initiation Protocol
					d:A SIP address is a URI that addresses a specific telephone extension on a voice over IP system. Such a number could be a private branch exchange or an E. 164 telephone number dialled through a specific gateway. The scheme was defined in RFC 3261. SIP is used for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions in applications of Internet telephony for voice and video calls, in private IP telephone systems, in instant messaging over Internet Protocol (IP) networks as well as mobile phone calling over LTE (VoLTE).
