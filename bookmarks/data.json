As system calls change and mature, bugs are found and eradicated. A certain subset of userland applications benefit by having a reduced set of available system calls. The resulting set reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application. System call filtering is meant for use with those applications.<p>Seccomp filtering provides a means for a process to specify a filter for incoming system calls. The filter is expressed as a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program, as with socket filters, except that the data operated on is related to the system call being made: system call number and the system call arguments. This allows for expressive filtering of system calls using a filter program language with a long history of being exposed to userland and a straightforward data set.<p>Additionally, BPF makes it impossible for users of seccomp to fall prey to time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks that are common in system call interposition frameworks. BPF programs may not dereference pointers which constrains all filters to solely evaluating the system call arguments directly."},{"name":"Vulnerable containers","url":"https://vulnerablecontainers.org/"},{"name":"jessfraz on github","url":"https://github.com/jessfraz/dockerfiles","tip":"Lots of GUI running in containers"},{"name":"Binary Edge","url":"https://binaryedge.io"},{"name":"gVisor sandboxing","url":"https://gvisor.dev/"}]},{"name":"CNCF","tag":"cloud","tip":"Cloud Native Computing Foundation","url":"https://www.cncf.io","children":[{"name":"CNCF landscape","tip":"Cloud Native Trail Map","url":"https://landscape.cncf.io"},{"name":"Kubernetes (K8s)","tip":"Containers Orchestrator","url":"https://kubernetes.io/","children":[{"name":"Falco","tag":"k8s,security","url":"https://falco.org/","tip":"Kubernetes threat detection engine","children":[{"name":"Security Hub","tag":"k8s,security","tip":"Kubernetes security best practices and configurations","url":"https://securityhub.dev/"}]}]}]}]},{"name":"Library & refs","children":[{"name":"O'Reilly","url":"https://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/bookshelfs.html","tip":"O'Reilly's CD bookshelf"},{"name":"ANT Tutorial","url":"https://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/docs/tutorials/docsystem/build/tutorials/ant/ant.html"},{"name":"JDK 11","url":"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/"},{"name":"Node.js","url":"https://nodejs.org/en/about/","children":[{"name":"Node: Up and Running","url":"http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/index.html"},{"name":"Why Use Node.js?","tip":"A Comprehensive Tutorial with Examples | Toptal","url":"https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js"},{"name":"Website in Node.js","tip":"A Simple Website in Node.js with Express, Jade and Stylus | Clock","url":"http://www.clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus"}]},{"name":"Python","children":[{"name":"Python 3 documentation","url":"https://docs.python.org/3/download.html"},{"name":"Python Programming","tip":"Wikibooks, open books for an open world","url":"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming"},{"name":"A Byte of Python","url":"http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/"}]},{"name":"Ruby","children":[{"name":"Ruby Version Manager","tip":"Bundler Integration with RVM","url":"https://rvm.io/integration/bundler"}]}]}]}
