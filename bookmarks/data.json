As system calls change and mature, bugs are found and eradicated. A certain subset of userland applications benefit by having a reduced set of available system calls. The resulting set reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application. System call filtering is meant for use with those applications.<p>Seccomp filtering provides a means for a process to specify a filter for incoming system calls. The filter is expressed as a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) program, as with socket filters, except that the data operated on is related to the system call being made: system call number and the system call arguments. This allows for expressive filtering of system calls using a filter program language with a long history of being exposed to userland and a straightforward data set.<p>Additionally, BPF makes it impossible for users of seccomp to fall prey to time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) attacks that are common in system call interposition frameworks. BPF programs may not dereference pointers which constrains all filters to solely evaluating the system call arguments directly."},{"name":"Vulnerable containers","tag":"security","url":"https://vulnerablecontainers.org/"},{"name":"Binary Edge","tag":"security","url":"https://binaryedge.io"},{"name":"gVisor sandboxing","tag":"security","tip":"Sandbox runtime providing a virtualized container environment running containers with a new user-space kernel, delivering a low overhead container security solution for high-density applications.","desc":"gVisor is an open-source, <a href='https://www.opencontainers.org/'>OCI-compatible</a> sandbox runtime that provides a virtualized container environment.
